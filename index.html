                <h2>THE MOUSE <br> GHOST STORY</h2>
                <p>There was once a tiny little mouse who was so terrified of being trampled and squished by all the other animals in the forest that he always hid in the bushes. It was almost as if they enjoyed scaring him or threatening him. </p>
                <p>One day as the mouse was wandering around during the night, a strong wind began to blow. Suddenly, a white cloth came flying with the wind and landed over the mouse. As he began to shuffle around, an idea came to his mind.</p>
                <p>He should pretend to be a vicious ghost. And that is what he did. During the night he would keep on the white cloth over his body and loom around the forest till some animals spotted him. They were instantly petrified. Soon word began
                    to spread and all the animals found out that there was a ghost which lived on the dark path in the forest.</p>
                <p>The mouse was pretty happy. Now he did not have to fear being trampled by the animals and could live in peace, since none of them were brave enough to cross the path where a ghost had been spotted, and if they did, the mouse would chase
                    them away.
                </p>
                <p>One day, as seasons changed, a lot of animals had to migrate and had to go down the path where the ghost lived.
                </p>
                <p> “Oh boy, oh boy, I hope the ghost isn’t around today” whispered one of them. </p>
                <p>But as soon as they began to walk down that path, the mouse appeared and began to chase them out. But suddenly a gush of wind blew and the white cloth flew off the teeny tiny mouse and he was exposed.
                </p>
                <p>The animals were so angry that they chased him out of the forest and he was never allowed to come back. </p>
